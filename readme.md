Goals for These Rep Theory Notes
===


There are a few things I want to do related to the basic representation theory presented in these notes.

**TODO:**

<font color"green">Does github support colored text in markdown?</font>

 - Fix the proof of Schur's theorem
 - Describe why I call things a "completeness relation" 

**Goals of the document:**

1. Provide a good set of reference notes and study material for the basic theorems of representation theory of finite groups (basic theorems, characters, and character tables).
2. Describe Schoenflies notation, provide illustrations and Mathematica code for the point groups, and write down their character tables.
3. Briefly describe the irreps of $SO(3)$ and their visualization in terms of orbitals. Draw [minutephysics style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Xb2GFK2yc) animations or still photos of the orbitals, maybe using [mitsuba 2](https://mitsuba2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)?
4. Decompositions of Spin(N) into various irreps, and their visualization via surfaces of constant probability density AND via minutephysics-esque stuff.

**Issues to Solve:**

- path-traced rendering. I really don't want to have to learn Blender.
- How to choose between degenerate decompositions? $Spin(2)\simeq A\oplus 2T$, so there's some choice about how to block diagonalize.

**Things I probably shouldn't get too deep into:**

 - The relationship between $Y^{\ell} _ m$ and group theory.
 - Applications in molecular physics and finding molecular orbitals (although a little bit of this would be good)
 - The hydrogen atom in a magnetic field
 - The "lie" of atomic orbitals
